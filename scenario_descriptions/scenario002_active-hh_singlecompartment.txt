title = Scenario 01: Responses of passive cell to step current injection

description = """
In a simulation from t=0 to t=350
Create a single compartment neuron cell1:
 - area <A>, initial voltage <VS>
 - capacitance <C>.
Add Hodge-Huxley Na channels to cell1 <gBarNa> <erev_k> 
Add Hodge-Huxley K channels to cell1  <gBarK>  <erev_k> 
Add Hodge-Huxley LK channels to cell1 <gBarLK>, <erev_lk>

Inject cell1 with step current <I> from t=100ms until t=250ms
Record cell1.V as $V
Record cell1.Na.i as $i_na
Record cell1.K.i as $i_k
Record cell1.LK.i as $i_k
Record cell1.Na.m as $m
Record cell1.Na.h as $h
Record cell1.Na.n as $n

Run the simulation
