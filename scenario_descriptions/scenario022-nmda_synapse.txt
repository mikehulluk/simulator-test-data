title = Scenario 023: Response of a passive cell to time synaptic input (double exponential with voltage dependance)

description = """
In a simulation from t=0 to t=350
Create a single compartment neuron cell1
Add Hodge-Huxley:LK channels to cell1 with density 0.3mS/cm2 and reversalpotential -54.3
- area 1000um2 initial voltage -52
 - capacitance 1.0uF/cm2
Create an alpha synapse SYN with conductance <gBar> and reversalpotential <erev> and opening-time <t_open> and closing-time <t_close> and mg-concentration <MGCONC> at cell1 
Drive SYN with spike times [100, 150, 150.5, 200, 200.2, 200.4]
Record cell1.V as $V
Record SYN.g as $SYN_G
Record SYN.i as $SYN_I
Run the simulation
