title = Scenario 003: Responses of cell with dIN conductances to step current injection (No Calcium)

description = """
In a simulation from t=0 to t=350
Create a single compartment neuron cell1:
- area 1000um2 initial voltage -52
 - capacitance 1.0uF/cm2
Add dIN:Na channels to cell1 
Add dIN:Kf channels to cell1 
Add dIN:Ks channels to cell1 
Add dIN:LK channels to cell1 
Inject cell1 with step current <I> from t=100ms until t=250ms
Record cell1.V as $V
Record cell1.Na.i as $i_na
Record cell1.Kf.i as $i_kf
Record cell1.Ks.i as $i_ks
Record cell1.LK.i as $i_lk
Run the simulation
